# Python Programming: Intermediate Level

**Objective**: By the end of this course, you will be able to work with more advanced Python concepts such as object-oriented programming, file handling, libraries, and modules. They will also be introduced to the fundamentals of working with external APIs and databases.

## Module 1: Advanced Data Structures

### Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries (Deep Dive)

- Nested lists and comprehensions
- Advanced dictionary methods: `get()`, `setdefault()`, `.update()`
- Sorting lists and tuples with `sorted()`, `key` parameter
- Using `zip()` for combining lists

### Sets and Frozensets

- Set theory: union, intersection, difference
- Adding/removing elements in sets
- Frozen sets and when to use them

---

## Module 2: Functions and Modules

### Advanced Functions

- Default argument values
- Variable-length arguments: `*args` and `**kwargs`
- Lambda functions and `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- Function decorators (basic introduction)
- Scope and closures

### Modules and Packages

- Importing modules and using `import`, `from ... import`
- Creating and using custom modules
- Using external packages (Installing via `pip`)
- Exploring common Python libraries: `math`, `random`, `datetime`

---

## Module 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Classes and Objects

- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Defining classes and creating objects
- Class attributes and instance attributes
- Methods: instance methods, class methods, static methods

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

- Inheritance in Python
- Method overriding
- Multiple inheritance and the `super()` function
- Encapsulation and private members
- Polymorphism in Python

---

## Module 4: Error Handling and Exceptions (Advanced)

### Handling Multiple Exceptions

- Revisiting basic exception handling: `try`, `except`, `finally`
- Catching multiple exceptions
- Custom exception classes
- Using `assert` for debugging
- Cleaning up resources with `finally`

---

## Module 5: File Handling and Working with CSV

### File I/O Operations (Deep Dive)

- Working with different file modes: `r`, `w`, `a`, `rb`, `wb`
- Working with directories: `os` and `shutil` modules
- Managing file paths using `os.path` and `pathlib`

### Reading and Writing CSV Files

- Introduction to CSV format
- Reading and writing CSV files using the `csv` module
- Working with CSV files using `pandas` (optional introduction)

---

## Module 6: Working with APIs and JSON Data

### Introduction to APIs and JSON

- What is an API? Introduction to RESTful APIs
- Making HTTP requests using `requests` module
- Parsing JSON data: loading, accessing, and modifying JSON
- Sending data with POST requests

---

## Module 7: Regular Expressions (Regex)

### Understanding and Using Regular Expressions

- Introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Common regex patterns for text matching
- Using the `re` module: `match()`, `search()`, `findall()`, `sub()`
- Applications of regex in text processing

---

## Module 8: Working with Databases

### Introduction to SQLite

- Introduction to relational databases
- Setting up and working with SQLite in Python using `sqlite3`
- Basic SQL operations: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Connecting Python to an external database
- Querying data from the database

---

## Module 9: Introduction to Testing and Debugging

### Debugging and Logging

- Using Python's `pdb` module for debugging
- Effective use of print debugging vs using `pdb`
- Using logging for tracking program execution (`logging` module)

### Unit Testing in Python

- Introduction to unit testing
- Writing tests using `unittest`
- Writing test cases for functions and classes
- Running tests and checking results

---

## Module 10: Final Project and Course Review

### Project: Python Application

- Design and implement a more complex Python project, applying the concepts learned. Example projects:
  - A simple command-line game using OOP and file I/O
  - A web scraper using APIs and regular expressions
  - A basic database-backed application using SQLite

### Review and Next Steps

- Recap of key concepts
- Introduction to advanced topics for future learning (e.g., web frameworks, machine learning, networking)
