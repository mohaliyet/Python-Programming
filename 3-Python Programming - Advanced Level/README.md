- Chaining multiple decorators
- Use cases for advanced decorators (caching, access control)

### Generators and Iterators

- Revisiting generators and iterators
- Building custom iterators using `__iter__` and `__next__`
- Understanding the generator lifecycle (`yield` and `send()`)
- `itertools` module: useful iterator functions

### Context Managers

- Introduction to context managers and `with` statements
- Creating custom context managers using `__enter__` and `__exit__`
- The `contextlib` module for simplifying context managers

## Module 3: Functional Programming in Python

### Functional Programming Concepts

- Understanding functional programming: map, filter, reduce
- First-class functions and higher-order functions
- Pure functions, immutability, and stateless functions
- Anonymous functions (lambda) and function composition

### Closures and Currying

- Understanding closures and non-local variables
- Function currying for transforming functions
- Decorators as closures

---

## Module 4: Concurrency and Parallelism

### Multithreading and Multiprocessing

- Differences between concurrency and parallelism
- Introduction to multithreading: `threading` module
- Synchronizing threads: locks, semaphores, and barriers
- Multiprocessing in Python: `multiprocessing` module
- Shared memory, message passing, and process pools

### Asyncio and Asynchronous Programming

- Understanding asynchronous programming
- Coroutines and the `async`/`await` syntax
- `asyncio` module for concurrency
- Creating non-blocking I/O with `asyncio`
- Working with tasks, event loops, and futures

---

## Module 5: Working with Large Data and Performance Optimization

### File I/O Optimization and Memory Management

- Efficient reading and writing of large files
- Working with binary data
- Memory management in Python: garbage collection, reference counting
- Profiling memory usage with `memory_profiler`

### Performance Tuning

- Profiling code for performance bottlenecks (`timeit`, `cProfile`)
- Code optimization techniques (e.g., avoiding global variables, optimizing loops)
- Understanding and using the `lru_cache` decorator for caching
- Vectorization with `NumPy` for faster data processing

---

## Module 6: Working with Databases and Data Processing

### SQLAlchemy and ORM in Python

- Introduction to Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Setting up and configuring SQLAlchemy
- Working with models, sessions, and queries
- Relationships and foreign keys in SQLAlchemy
- Complex queries and transactions with SQLAlchemy

### Pandas for Data Analysis

- Revisiting `pandas` for data manipulation
- Efficient data processing with `pandas` (indexing, grouping, merging)
- Handling large datasets and performance considerations in `pandas`
- Practical use cases: cleaning and processing real-world datasets

---

## Module 7: Networking and Web Development

### Socket Programming and Networking

- Introduction to network programming
- Creating client-server architecture with `socket`
- Sending and receiving data over the network
- Using `select` for handling multiple connections

### Web Development with Flask

- Introduction to web development and the Flask framework
- Setting up a basic Flask web application
- Routing, templates, and static files
- Handling forms, session management, and cookies

---

## Module 8: Testing, Debugging, and Deployment

### Advanced Testing Techniques

- Revisiting unit tests and `unittest`
- Mocking and patching with `unittest.mock`
- Test-driven development (TDD) principles
- Writing tests for concurrent and asynchronous code

### Debugging and Profiling

- Advanced debugging with `pdb`, `ipdb`
- Profiling code for CPU and memory usage with `cProfile`, `line_profiler`
- Performance tuning based on profiling results
- Best practices for debugging and fixing complex issues

### Deployment and Packaging

- Packaging Python applications with `setuptools`
- Creating virtual environments with `venv` and `pipenv`
- Introduction to Docker for containerizing Python applications
- Deploying Python applications on cloud platforms (AWS, Heroku)

---

## Module 9: Final Project and Course Review

### Project: Full-Stack Python Application

- Design and implement a full-fledged Python application that integrates:
  - Advanced OOP concepts
  - Multithreading or asynchronous programming
  - Database operations
  - Web development (optional)
  - External API usage (optional)

### Review and Next Steps

- Recap of key concepts and best practices
- Exploring next steps in Python (machine learning, AI, networking, etc.)
